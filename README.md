# Obsidian Canvas Character Sheet

This vault contains the assets, canvas, fonts and CSS snippets required to use a DnD character sheet which was created using [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas).

This was a DnD character sheet created for the original author's DnD character. It is designed to be visually striking, user-friendly, and customizable to whatever type of character you play. Made with Canvas and two long CSS snippets. It should be relatively simple to adapt the existing cards/notes to use with whatever character you like, just change the text, add a few spells, delete a few, rename them to rogue proficiencies..?

No plugins are required, however:
- Dice Roller plugin by the infamous valentine195 was a last-minute addition for a 3D rollable hit dice. Click the d8 to roll it. https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller
- Better Canvas Lock by Mara-Li was added to help stabilize the canvas, and to keep blank 'cards' from popping up every time you click the canvas. Enable "Read-Only mode" to use it.  https://github.com/Mara-Li/obsidian-better-canvas-lock

Note: The gems on the medallion function as a death save counter.. with surprises! :D

- The .canvas file should be pinned when you first open the vault, but it is located at */Characters/Diero Falone/Canvas - Diero Falone*

**PLEASE NOTE:**
- The main snippets contains CSS that targets all canvases. If you choose to add this to your own vault, you might need to disable the snippets to use your other canvases normally.
- The two default "_embedded" snippets use locally embedded images. If for some bizarre reason you don't want to use them, you can disable them and enable the "_linked" CSS file to download the images every time you open the vault. Note that I backed them up in the folder inside the snippets folder as well. 
- Some elements have had their resizing/movement disabled for UX purposes. If you want to resize/rearrange the elements yourself, the CSS controlling that is at the top of the canvas_styling_linked or the canvas_styling_embedded CSS files (not the *_images CSS file) in the snippets folder.
- I disabled a handful of core plugins that have nothing to do with using a Character Sheet on Canvas. Feel free to enable whatever you like, to do whatever you need to, it's fine (won't break anything).
